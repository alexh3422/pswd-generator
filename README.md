# pswd-generator

Hello! Welcome to my password generator website. 

This website was created as a project through the UW CODING BOOTCAMP course that I am currently enrolled in. We were given the starting html and css code but had to build the javascript ourselves to create a random password ranging from 8-128 characters with the user choice of character types to put in. 

To use this website:
1. click generate password
2. select the amount of characters you would like your password to contain. If you pick a number that is less than 8 or more than 128 you will be prompted to try again. 
3. select the character types you would like by clicking OK on each prompt that comes up. You can choose to exclude a certain character type by clicking cancel on that character type's prompt. Please note you MUST click ok on at least one, otherwise you will have to start again. 

4. Once you go through those prompts selecting the length and character types, your password will be randomly generated including the character types you seleccted! You can then copy and paste the generated password and use it however you wish! 
5. If you would like to generate another password, just click "generate password" again. 

Thanks for using my password generator!
